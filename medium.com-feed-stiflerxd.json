By understanding their respective strengths and trade-offs, AI practitioners can make intelligent decisions when designing systems that need to understand and generate large contexts.</p>\n<h3><strong>Understanding Large Context Models(LCMs)</strong></h3>\n<p>Standard transformer-based language models, such as GPT and BERT variants, typically operate with a fixed context window — often limited to a few thousand tokens (e.g., 2,048 or 4,096 tokens). This constraint arises from the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism, which scales with the square of the input length. When inputs exceed this window, information is truncated, causing loss of context, decreased coherence, and weaker reasoning over long texts.</p>\n<p>Large Context Models address this limitation through architectural innovations and optimization strategies that enable processing of substantially longer inputs without prohibitive computational costs. Key approaches include:</p>\n<p><strong>Sparse Attention Mechanisms:</strong> Instead of attending to every token pair, sparse attention selectively focuses on local neighborhoods or predefined patterns (e.g., Longformer, BigBird). This reduces complexity from O(n²) to approximately O(n√n) or better, enabling thousands to tens of thousands of tokens.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Memory-Augmented Models:</strong> These models incorporate external memory modules (learned or static) that store relevant information from previous contexts, allowing the model to reference and update knowledge beyond immediate tokens (e.g., Transformer-XL, Compressive Transformer).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Recurrence and Chunking:</strong> Processing long sequences in chunks while maintaining contextual state across segments. This method approximates long-term dependency learning with manageable computational overhead.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Efficient Transformer Variants:</strong> Innovations like Performer (using random feature attention), Linformer, and Reformer focus on approximations to reduce attention complexity while preserving performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By enabling direct access to long-form input, Large Context Models excel in tasks requiring holistic understanding of extensive documents, multi-turn conversations, or multimodal inputs (e.g., text + images). This direct conditioning on large context improves answer consistency, summarization quality, and complex reasoning.</p>\n<p><strong>Architectural Flow</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*a6KgUMpy3FEYvrPpnOzGOQ.png\"><figcaption>LCM Architecture</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Example Use Cases for Large Context Models (LCMs)</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal and Financial Document Analysis:</strong> Processing lengthy contracts or reports in a single pass without chunking reduces the risk of missing critical information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Long-Form Content Generation:</strong> Generating coherent essays, stories, or reports where maintaining narrative flow over thousands of tokens is essential.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Multi-Session Dialogue Systems:</strong> Retaining long conversational history for personalized and contextually rich interactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Exploring LLM + RAG Pipelines</strong></h3>\n<p>While Large Context Models aim to process more tokens directly within the model, <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> takes a different architectural approach: rather than scaling the context window, it leverages an external knowledge source to dynamically inject relevant information at inference time.</p>\n<p>The typical <strong>LLM + RAG pipeline</strong> consists of two main components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Retriever Module:</strong><br>A vector-based search system (often built with dense embeddings from models like Sentence-BERT, Faiss, or ColBERT) that indexes a large corpus of documents, facts, or domain-specific data.

Memory-mapped inference</p>\n<h3>Quantization with GPTQ</h3>\n<p>To make Qwen2.5–3B edge-friendly, we applied GPTQ (Gradient Post-Training Quantization) a method that minimizes model size after training, without retraining.</p>\n<p>Key Benefits:</p>\n<p>️ 1. Works well with Transformer architectures</p>\n<p>️ 2. Supports 4-bit and 8-bit quantization</p>\n<p>3. Hugging Face Transformers &amp; GGUF Compatible</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/521/0*D9DvMmjPVbuY3M9R\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/weight-only-quantization-in-llm-inference.html\">Figure 3: int4 GEMM workflow</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The Workflow</h3>\n<p>Model Download:</p>\n<ul><li>We pulled Qwen2.5–3B from either Hugging Face or Alibaba’s ModelScope.</li></ul>\n<p>Quantization:</p>\n<ul><li>Applied 4-bit GPTQ quantization using the GPTQModel.</li></ul>\n<pre>quant_config = QuantizeConfig(<br>    bits=4,              # 4-bit quantization<br>    group_size=128,      # Group size<br>    desc_act=True        # Act-order (helps with accuracy)<br>)</pre>\n<p>Inference Optimization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Used the CUDA backend where it made sense</li>\n<li>Added low-level hooks to speed up matrix multiplications</li>\n<li>Enabled Triton and fused kernels for faster performance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deployment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Converted the model to GGUF format for compatibility with llama.cpp and edge runtimes like llamacpp-python and ctransformers.</li>\n<li>Successfully ran it on an RTX 3050 with 6GB of VRAM.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Memory &amp; Speed Gains</h3>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*I95jgvuUzEQoLztggRMCaQ.png\"><figcaption>Figure 4: Comparison FP16 vs. 4-bit</figcaption></figure><h3>Applications</h3>\n<p>With Qwen2.5–3B-GPTQ, edge AI use cases become possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offline Chatbots</li>\n<li>Embedded NLP for IoT devices</li>\n<li>Real-time smart assistants</li>\n<li>Voice-enabled edge applications</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Learnings</h3>\n<p>CUDA errors are prevalent with AutoGPTQ (has reached End-of-Life), rollover to manual GPTQ for dependability.</p>\n<p>Benchmark quantized models with caution, aggressive quantization can affect quality.</p>\n<h3>Future Work</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Qwen2.5–3B fine-tuning on domain-specific data after quantization with LoRA.</li>\n<li>Experimentation using AWQ &amp; GPTQ + LoRA hybrid for highly efficient mobile inference.</li>\n<li>In-depth investigation of Qwen2.5–1.5B or TinyGPT for even smaller models.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>GitHub + Resources</h3>\n<p><strong>Full Quantization Script: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/STiFLeR7/Edge-LLM\">GitHub</a></p>\n<p><strong>Qwen2.5–3B Official: </strong><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B\">HuggingFace</a></p>\n<p><strong>GPTQ Paper: </strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323\">Read Here</a></p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Thanks to smart quantization, powerful models like Qwen2.5–3B with 3 billion parameters can now run smoothly on edge hardware.
